# Docker XHProf

Provides a means of viewing xhprof profiles via a Docker container.

## Usage

1. Add the xhprof files you wish to view to the profiles directory.
2. Run `make`

When viewing the page, XHProf uses two query string parameters to find the profile to display. If you have a profile already generated by XHProf, named `5674908d6086e.someprocess.xhprof`, the URL should include the query string `run=5674908d6086e&source=someprocess`
